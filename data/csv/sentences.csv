57,31920787,1,1,Background,"Mindfulness is hypothesized to lead to more realistic appraisals of the three basic psychological needs, which leads people to benefit from high levels of need satisfaction or helps them make the appropriate changes to improve need satisfaction.",[]
58,31920787,1,2,Background,Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have also shown promise to foster greater basic psychological need satisfaction in students with learning disabilities (LDs).,[]
59,31920787,2,3,Objective,The goal of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a MBI on the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs and on internalized symptoms in students with severe LDs.,[]
60,31920787,2,4,Objective,"A randomized cluster trial was implemented to compare the progression of need satisfaction, anxiety, and depression symptoms in participants pre- to post-intervention and at follow-up.",[]
61,31920787,3,5,Method,Elementary school students with severe LDs ( N = 23) in two special education classrooms took part in this study and were randomly attributed to either an experimental or an active control group.,['D02']
62,31920787,4,6,Results,Mixed ANOVAs first showed that the experimental condition did not moderate change over time such that similar effects were observed in the experimental and active control groups.,['D09']

64,31920787,4,8,Results,"Post hoc analyses showed that for both groups, competence scores were significantly higher at post-intervention ( p = 0.03) and at follow-up ( p = 0.04), when compared to pre-intervention scores.",[]
65,31920787,4,9,Results,A significant main effect was also found for anxiety levels over time ( p = 0.008).,[]
66,31920787,4,10,Results,"Post hoc analyses showed that for both groups, scores were significantly lower at post-intervention ( p = 0.01) and at follow-up ( p = 0.006), when compared to pre-intervention scores.",[]
67,31920787,5,11,Conclusion,"Although the MBI seemed useful in increasing the basic psychological need of competence and decreasing anxiety symptoms in students with severe LDs, it was not more useful than the active control intervention that was used in this project.",[]
68,31920787,5,12,Conclusion,Future studies should verify that MBIs have an added value compared to other types of interventions that can be more easily implemented in school-based settings.,[]

76,32680417,3,7,Results,The intervention was not associated with changes in depression symptomology.,[]
77,32680417,4,8,Conclusions,Results underscore the importance of mitigating participation barriers prior to intervention roll-out and the need for increased evidence for psychological health interventions to mitigate depression among orphaned and vulnerable adolescents.,[]
78,32680417,4,9,Conclusions,This intervention and the study selectively targeted at-risk adolescents versus using diagnostic mental health criteria for enrollment; more research is needed to identify the potential benefits and disadvantages of these approaches.,[]

155,26220564,1,2,Background,Existing mental health programs aimed at addressing these issues in adolescents have repeated inconsistent results.,[]
156,26220564,1,3,Background,"Such programs have generally been based on techniques derived from cognitive behavioral therapy, which may not be ideally suited to early intervention among adolescent samples.",[]
157,26220564,1,4,Background,"Positive psychology, which seeks to improve well-being rather than alleviate psychological symptoms, offers an alternative approach.",[]
158,26220564,1,5,Background,A previous community study of adolescents found that informal engagement in an online positive psychology program for up to 6 weeks yielded significant improvements in both well-being and depression symptoms.,[]

987,31981802,1,1,Objective,Adult research supports the efficacy of targeting the malleable risk factor of anxiety sensitivity (AS) in preventing anxiety and related psychopathology.,[]
988,31981802,1,2,Objective,"However, very little work has evaluated the impact of AS reduction among youth, which is unfortunate given adolescence is a ""core risk"" period in terms of disorder onset.",[]

991,31981802,3,5,Results,"Youth in the intervention condition sustained low AS levels across the intervention period, and although AS levels in both conditions decreased from baseline to the one-month assessment, this decrease was more pronounced at one-month for youth in the intervention condition.",[]

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\nResults : A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\nConclusions : In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 110 11 viral particles per mL or 510 10 viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389.\nFindings : 603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 397 years, SD 125) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (110 11 viral particles n=253; 510 10 viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 110 11 and 510 10 viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 6565 (95% CI 5752-7492) and 5710 (4676-6973), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93-98) and 97% (92-99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 195 (95% CI 168-227) and 183 (144-233) in participants receiving 110 11 and 510 10 viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon  enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85-93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81-92) of 129 participants in the 110 11 and 510 10 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 110 11 and 510 10 viral particles dose groups, respectively.

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug.\nObjective : To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19.\nDesign, setting, and participants : This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.\nInterventions : Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days).\nMain outcomes and measures : Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4.\nResults : Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).\nConclusions and relevance : The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.\nTrial registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527.", "questions": {"C12a": "For the primary outcome(s) , is there a summary report of results for each group ?", "C08": "Are they mentioning whether or not participants, trial providers and data collectors were blinded ?", "C12b": "For the primary outcome(s) , is the estimated effect size clearly stated ?", "C08a": "Is there only a brief description of blinding (eg, single-blind, double-blind, triple-blind) ?", "C16": "Are the source of funding and supports clearly stated ?", "C14a": "Are the benefits and harms balanced in the conclusion ?", "C04": "Are the interventions sufficiently detailed for each group (eg, when, how) ?", "C11a": "Are the numbers of participants analyzed in accordance with the original grouping (eg, intention-to-treat analysis or pre-protocol analysis) ?", "C15": "Are the trial registration number and the name of trial register clearly stated ?

We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods : We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 510 10 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT 50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA 50, MNA 80, and MNA 90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon- enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606.\nFindings : Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<005). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493-1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96-317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360-792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA 80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT 50. After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA 80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R 2=067 by Marburg VN; p<0001).\nInterpretation : ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses.

Of 2,250 adolescents screened for eligibility, 446 participants completed the baseline interview and 369 were randomized into CATCH-IT (n=193) and HE (n=176).\nInterventions : CATCH-IT is a 20-module (15 adolescent modules, 5 parent modules) online psychoeducation course that includes a parent program, supported by three motivational interviews.\nMain outcomes and measures : Time-to-event for depressive episode; depressive symptoms at 6 months.\nResults : Mean age was 15.4 years, and 68% were female; 28% had both a past episode and subsyndromal depression; 12% had a past episode only, 59% had subsyndromal depression only, and 1% had borderline subsyndromal depression. The outcome of time-to-event favored CATCH-IT but was not significant with intention-to-treat analyses (N=369;  unadjusted HR=0.59; 95% CI 0.27, 1.29; p=0.18;  adjusted HR=0.53; 95% CI 0.23, 1.23, p=0.14). Adolescents with higher baseline CES-D 10 scores showed a significantly stronger effect of CATCH-IT on time-to-event relative to those with lower baseline scores (p=0.04). For example, for a CES-D 10 score of 15 (significant sub-syndromal depression), HR=0.20 (95% CI 0.05, 0.77), compared to CES-D 10 of 5 (no sub-syndromal depression), HR=1.44 (95% CI, 0.41, 5.03). In both CATCH-IT and HE groups, depression symptoms declined and functional scores increased.\nConclusions and relevance : CATCH-IT may be better than HE for preventing depressive episodes for at-risk adolescents with sub-syndromal depression. CATCH-IT may be a scalable approach to prevent depressive episodes in adolescents in primary care.", "questions": {"D14b": "Do the authors provide the name of the trial register ?", "D05": "Are there specific objectives or hypothesis stated ?", "D07": "If they declared a random allocation to interventions (if they did not answer no), do the authors correctly report how they were allocated (e.g., computer-generated, random numbers, coin toss, etc.) ?", "D08b": "Do authors describe if the program deliverer (caregiver) were blinded ?

Data collection occurred from 1996 to 1998.\nIntervention : Children and caregivers in the intervention condition met separately for 12 two-hour weekly sessions. Skills targeted by the program for children included positive coping, stress appraisals, control beliefs, and self-esteem. The caregiver program targeted caregiver mental health, life stressors, and improved discipline in the home. Both child and caregiver programs focused on improved quality of the caregiver-child relationship.\nMain outcome measures : Child and caregiver reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.\nResults : Longitudinal growth curve modeling was performed to model symptoms over time from the point of parental death. The rate of recovery for girls in the program condition was significantly different from that of girls in the control condition across all outcomes. Boys in both conditions showed reduced symptoms over time.\nConclusions : The methodology offers a conceptually unique way of assessing recovery in terms of reduced mental health problems over time after an event and has contributed to further understanding of FBP intervention effects.

The overall aim of this small RCT was to compare MBCT-C to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), as a preventive program for children experiencing internalizing difficulties.\nMethods : A mixed factorial design was used, with 2 (program group) by 2 (pre- and post-intervention) conditions. Children from 3 primary schools were randomized to MBCT-C (n = 45) or CBT (n = 44) using random permuted blocks, with stratification by school, gender, and age. Main analyses were multi-level mixed models.\nResults : Contrary to the hypotheses, only limited differences were found between programs. Both programs had small effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life, attention control, and parent- and teacher-SDQ Total Difficulties, as well as moderate-large effects on shifting attention. There were no statistically significant changes in mindfulness or sustained attention.\nConclusions : This RCT provides a robust test of MBCT-C in a “real life” setting, demonstrating that it may be used as a clinically oriented preventive program in schools to reduce internalizing symptoms. The results challenge whether attention (as measured in this study) is a unique component of change for MBCT-C.", "questions": {"D14b": "Do the authors provide the name of the trial register ?", "D08b": "Do authors describe if the program deliverer (caregiver) were blinded ?

High AS youth and a parent were randomly assigned to either the ASAP-Y, which consisted of psychoeducation and experimenter-led and parent-led exposures, or a general health information control condition.\nResults : Youth in the intervention condition sustained low AS levels across the intervention period, and although AS levels in both conditions decreased from baseline to the one-month assessment, this decrease was more pronounced at one-month for youth in the intervention condition. Further, significant indirect effects of condition on one-month anxiety and depression symptoms via reduced AS were detected. Homework compliance rates and self-report data support the acceptability of the ASAP-Y.

Innovative strategies to improve access and adherence to treatment are needed.\nObjectives: To assess the effectiveness of a contextualized intervention strategy aimed at improving patients' adherence to treatment and to evaluate its impact on TB control in a resource-poor country in Africa with prevalent TB infection.\nDesign, setting, and patients: A cluster randomized controlled trial, conducted between June 2003 and January 2005, at 16 government district health centers in Senegal. Patients older than 15 years with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group.\nIntervention: The intervention strategy included reinforced counseling through improved communication between health personnel and patients, decentralization of treatment, choice of directly observed therapy (DOT) supporter by the patient, and reinforcement of supervision activities.

BC is associated with higher response rates than other regimens, but it has never been tested in an adjuvant setting.\nMethods: We conducted a prospective randomized phase III study comparing the clinical benefit of IFN and BC in pts who had undergone lymphadenectomy within 56 days for melanoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes. Pts were randomized to receive BC (Cisplatin 20 mg/m2 IV [d1–4]; Vinblastine 1.5 mg/m2 IV [d1–4]; DTIC 800 mg/m2 IV [d1]; IFN 5 MU/m2 SQ [d1–5]; IL-2 9 MU/m2 continuous IV infusion [d1–4] every 3 wks for 4 courses) or IFN, and those who were randomized to IFN were further randomized to either HDI (20 MU/m2 IV for 5 d/week for 4 wks and 10 MU/m2 SQ 3 times a wk for 48 wks) or intermediate-dose IFN (IDI) (10 MU/m2 SQ 3 times a wk for 1 year).

The cutoff date for analysis was July 21, 2022.\nInterventions: After first-line induction therapy with 8 cycles of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, patients without disease progression were randomized (1:1) to biweekly maintenance with cetuximab or observation. On disease progression, the same induction regimen was recommended for 16 weeks followed by further maintenance with cetuximab or observation until disease progression under the full induction regimen.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary end point was the 6-month progression-free rate from randomization. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. An exploratory biomolecular analysis, using next-generation sequencing, investigated the putative prognostic value of the tumor mutation profile.\nResults: Of 214 patients enrolled (141 men [65.9%]; median age, 67 years [range, 23-85 years]), 139 were randomized to receive cetuximab (n = 67; 45 men [67.2%]; median age, 64 years [range, 34-85 years]) or to be observed (n = 72; 50 men [69.4%]; median age, 68 years [23-85 years]). The 6-month progression-free rate was 38.8% ([26 of 67] 95% CI, 27.1%-51.5%) in the cetuximab group and 5.6% ([4 of 72] 95% CI, 1.5%-13.6%) in the observation group. At a median follow-up of 40.5 months (95% CI, 33.6-47.5 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization was 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.4 months) in the cetuximab group and 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.8-2.7 months) in the observation group. Median overall survival (OS) was 24.8 months (95% CI, 18.7-30.4 months) in the cetuximab group and 19.7 months (95% CI, 13.3-24.4 months) in the observation group. In an exploratory multivariate analysis, any tumor-activating mutation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes was associated with shorter PFS from randomization regardless of treatment group (hazard ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.01-2.62]; P = .04). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxic effect in the cetuximab group during maintenance therapy was rash (8 of 67 [11.9%]).\nConclusion and relevance: The randomized clinical trial did not meet its primary end point but suggests clinically meaningful PFS and OS benefits associated with cetuximab maintenance therapy. However, maintenance cetuximab or treatment breaks after first-line combination FOLFIRI-cetuximab therapy seems inappropriate for patients with MAPK-mutated independently of the side of primary tumor.

PBI employs a shorter course of radiation therapy to a smaller breast field and is the subject of randomized efficacy trials. Concurrent administration of PBI and adjuvant chemotherapy would decrease duration of therapy, allow more women to pursue BCT, improve compliance, and potentially enhance local control.\nMethods: To examine the feasibility, safety, and short-term risk of recurrence of concurrent PBI with adjuvant ddAC, we are conducting a prospective one-stage, single-arm trial of PBI during the first 2 of 4 cycles of ddAC (60 and 600 mg/m2, respectively) delivered q14d with growth factor support.

Primary endpoints (skin/soft tissue toxicity and cosmetic outcome) are graded by a panel of physicians using commonly accepted scales. Digital images at baseline, during, and q 3–6 months after PBI are obtained for comparison. Additional chemo and endocrine Rx post ddAC given at the physician’s discretion. We report preliminary safety data.\nResults: Between 11/04 and 9/05, 10 pts were enrolled and received study therapy (accrual goal = 42); 2 pts also received dd paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 post ddAC. All pts received planned PBI (med. f/u 6 mos, range 3–12 mos). 2 pts missed 1 and 2 cycles of ddAC because of stomatitis (Gr 3) and diverticulitis, respectively. 3 other pts had 1–2 wk chemo delay because of hand-foot syndrome, brief pulmonary syndrome, and febrile neutropenia. No pts developed radiation dermatitis > Gr 1 or radiation recall. All pts had cosmetic outcome grades of good or excellent shortly after completion of therapy.

The proportion of patients defaulting was reduced in the intervention group to 5.5% (n = 43) compared with 16.8% (n = 125) in the control group (adjusted RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Conclusion: The intervention package based on improved patients counseling and communication, decentralization of treatment, patient choice of DOT supporter, and reinforcement of supervision activities led to improvement in patient outcomes compared with the usual TB control procedures. This approach may be generalized in the context of TB control programs in resource-poor countries.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00412009.

The primary outcome was change in pain from baseline to 60 minutes after treatment with study medication as measured by using a visual analog scale.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Results: A total of 336 patients were randomly assigned, and 300 were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (100 in the acetaminophen group, 100 in the ibuprofen group, and 100 in the codeine group). Study groups were similar in age, gender, final diagnosis, previous analgesic given, and baseline pain score. Patients in the ibuprofen group had a significantly greater improvement in pain score (mean decrease: 24 mm) than those in the codeine (mean decrease: 11 mm) and acetaminophen (mean decrease: 12 mm) groups at 60 minutes. In addition, at 60 minutes more patients in the ibuprofen group achieved adequate analgesia (as defined by a visual analog scale <30 mm) than the other 2 groups. There was no significant difference between patients in the codeine and acetaminophen groups in the change in pain score at any time period or in the number of patients achieving adequate analgesia.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Conclusions: For the treatment of acute traumatic musculoskeletal injuries, ibuprofen provides the best analgesia among the 3 study medications.

PBI employs a shorter course of radiation therapy to a smaller breast field and is the subject of randomized efficacy trials. Concurrent administration of PBI and adjuvant chemotherapy would decrease duration of therapy, allow more women to pursue BCT, improve compliance, and potentially enhance local control. \nMethods: To examine the feasibility, safety, and short-term risk of recurrence of concurrent PBI with adjuvant ddAC, we are conducting a prospective one-stage, single-arm trial of PBI during the first 2 of 4 cycles of ddAC (60 and 600 mg/m2, respectively) delivered q14d with growth factor support. Patients (pts) with T1–2 N0–1 breast cancer and lumpectomy margins ≥ 3mm are eligible. PBI starts within 3 days of first chemo dose and treats the lumpectomy bed plus margin with 270 cGy fractions × 15 (4050 cGy total). Primary endpoints (skin/soft tissue toxicity and cosmetic outcome) are graded by a panel of physicians using commonly accepted scales. Digital images at baseline, during, and q 3–6 months after PBI are obtained for comparison. Additional chemo and endocrine Rx post ddAC given at the physician’s discretion. We report preliminary safety data.\nResults: Between 11/04 and 9/05, 10 pts were enrolled and received study therapy (accrual goal = 42); 2 pts also received dd paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 post ddAC. All pts received planned PBI (med. f/u 6 mos, range 3–12 mos). 2 pts missed 1 and 2 cycles of ddAC because of stomatitis (Gr 3) and diverticulitis, respectively. 3 other pts had 1–2 wk chemo delay because of hand-foot syndrome, brief pulmonary syndrome, and febrile neutropenia. No pts developed radiation dermatitis > Gr 1 or radiation recall. All pts had cosmetic outcome grades of good or excellent shortly after completion of therapy. No pts with ≥ 6 mos f/u since PBI had late skin toxicity.\nConclusion: Early results suggest that PBI concurrent with ddAC appears feasible and safe. Trial enrolment continues and longer f/u is required.

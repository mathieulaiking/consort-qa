\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
id & question \\
\midrule
01 & Is the study identified as randomized in the title ? \\
02 & Is there a structured summary of the trial design (e.g., parallel, crossover, cluster, or any association of designs) ? \\
03a & Are the eligibility criteria for participants mentioned? \\
03b & Are the settings or locations where the data were collected stated in the abstract ? \\
04a & Are the interventions sufficiently detailed for the experimental intervention (e.g., when, how) ? \\
04b & Are the interventions sufficiently detailed for the comparison (= control) intervention  (e.g., when, how) ? \\
05 & Is there a specific objective or hypothesis reported ? \\
06a & Do the authors explicitly state the primary outcome as such (primary, main, principal, measure, outcome and other synonyms are valid) ? \\
06b & If they declared explicitly a primary outcome, do the authors explicitly state when the primary outcome was assessed (time frame) ? \\
07 & If they declared a random allocation to interventions (if they did not answer no), do the authors correctly report how they were allocated (e.g., computer-generated, random numbers, coin toss, etc.) ? \\
08a & Do authors describe if participants were blinded ? (answer yes only if participants are blinded, do not care about caregivers or outcome assessors) \\
08b & Do authors describe if the program deliverer (caregiver) were blinded ? (answer yes only if caregivers are blinded, do not care about participants or outcome assessors) \\
08c & Do authors describe if data collectors (outcome assessors, analysts) were blinded ? (answer yes only if data collectors are blinded, do not care about participants or caregivers) \\
09 & Are the numbers of participants randomized to each group clearly stated ? \\
10 & Are the numbers of participants analyzed for each group clearly stated (not the number randomized but the patients included in the analysis of the primary outcome)? \\
11 & For the primary outcome, is there a result for each group and the estimated effect size and its precision (e.g., 95\% CI ) ? (if one of them is missing, answer no) \\
12 & Do the authors correctly mention the presence or absence of adverse events or side effects ? \\
13a & Do the authors state the conclusions of the trial? \\
13b & Do the authors state implications for further research or clinical practice ? \\
14a & Do the authors provide the trial registration number ? \\
